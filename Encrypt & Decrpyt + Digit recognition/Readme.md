In this project we use the image from peppers.bmp, encrypt it and than decrypt it back. 

After that, in the image test.bmp we have some hand written digits. We will make a template matching algorithm for digit recognition.
In the file cifra0,cifra1...cifra9.bmp we have the digits from 0 to 9. The algorithm will make a border of each digit with the specific color.
Then we will export the result in a bmp file .
